# Celeb Heights ‚Äì Estimating Human Height from Images Using CNN and Mask R-CNN

This repository was created as part of a dissertation project and focuses on estimating human height from images using a two-part deep learning approach:

1. **Height Classification using CNN**  
   A custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained to classify individuals into discrete height categories based on labeled celebrity images.

2. **Human Segmentation using Mask R-CNN**  
   A pre-trained Mask R-CNN model is used to segment humans in images, allowing for future development of pixel-based height estimation.

## üìä Dataset

- **Training Data**: A directory of celebrity images organized into subdirectories by height class (e.g., `170`, `180`, `190`, etc.).
- **Test Data**: Additional unseen images used to evaluate model generalization.
- **Segmentation Input**: Archive of celebrity images for use with Mask R-CNN.
